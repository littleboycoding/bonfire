# Structure Specification 0.0.1

At projects root there should have `data` directory which will contain following

- 📁 assets - directory that contain all raw file for example sprite, audio, javascript
- 📄 db.sqlite - database for game
- 📄 bonfire.js - main library helper act as minimalist game engine

> In future version, I will (hopefully) implement `init` command to help scaffolding project
